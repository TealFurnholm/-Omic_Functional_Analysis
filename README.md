# Visualize And Compare Gene Functions In Your Meta-omics Data

Greetings! 

I've pulled together and spruced up data from a variety of functional databases. I'll provide instructions of how to do advanced key word search and counts in Excel, and then how to do some very neat visualizations of the functions, so you can compare across samples. 
If you have NGS reads, I STRONGLY recommend you run them through my meta-omics pipeline: https://github.com/TealFurnholm/Metatranscriptome
That way you can get your genes the full analysis, linking the gene's source organism(s) and gene functions in the analysis output.

Good luck!
